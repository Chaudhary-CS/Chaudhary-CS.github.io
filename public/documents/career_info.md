### 7\. Research & Publications

Title: An Assessment Of ChatGPT 4o Performance on Mechanical Engineering Concept Inventories  
Conference Name: 2025 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition  
Date of Acceptance: June 15th, 2025  
Co-authors: Dr. Rujun Gao, Hillary E. Merzdorf, Xiaosu Guo, Dr. Kristi J. Shryock, Prof. Arun R Srinivasa  
Abstract:  
\- Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o show promise for enhancing engineering education through real-time support and personalized feedback. However, their reliability in interpreting the conceptual diagrams central to mechanical engineering remains uncertain. This study evaluates ChatGPT-4o’s performance on four concept inventories—Force Concept Inventory, Materials Concept Inventory, Mechanics Baseline Test, and Mechanics of Materials Concept Inventory—using assessments by two Mechanical Engineering professors based on correctness, depth of explanation, and application of theoretical knowledge. While ChatGPT-4o demonstrates the ability to provide robust explanations, it often lacks the contextual depth required for higher-order concept mastery, especially when reasoning from diagrams. These findings align with existing literature highlighting AI’s limitations in discipline-specific support. Future research should refine AI responses to better align with engineering problem-solving approaches and explore hybrid models integrating AI assistance with human instruction, potentially leading to more effective AI-augmented learning platforms in mechanical engineering education.
