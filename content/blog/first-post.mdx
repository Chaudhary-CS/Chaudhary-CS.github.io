# My First Post

Welcome to my blogâ€¦

Page transitions:
Framer Motion:
    Viewport-based animations are inherently unreliable for content that might already be visable when the page loads. Timeline-based animations
    give us the complete control over the sequence and timing
AI Assistants:
    GPT-o4-mini at the start, and then transitioned to Claude-4-sonnet because it did a better job of showing the correct way to fix a problem
    so I can learn properly
Cursor:
    Since it has the codebase as a reference, Cursor helps with understanding the big picture

Took me a week to build the baseline part of the website minus the up to date information, resume and cv, and writing these blog posts
